# Config files for VIM/GVIM
This folder contains the vimrc file used in my vim configuration.
It is not perfect but it works.

I am continously updating it to meet my needs

**Please note that these files may not be useful to you 
as they are for my preferref use case only**

## Files
- Keep the ```_vimrc ``` file in the home directory.
- Place ```PaperColor.vim``` in the ```vimfile/colors``` directory.
( if you want any other color you can download it and place it there ).
- To enable the use of plugins downlaod ```Plug.vim``` and put it in ```vimfiles/autoload``` directory. (If you do not do this 
VIM will always show some error at startup unless you remove/comment it from _vimrc files)
- You can edit line 194 to add your own skeleton files. (It will write a default/beginner section of a program when you create a new file.)
- Skeleton files are placed in ```vimfiles/.vim/template/``` directory.

**NOTE** : This config file also contain some shortcuts and shorthand functions. you can explore more by reading the ```_vimrc``` file.
